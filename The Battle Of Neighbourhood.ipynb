Specifically, it will be targeted to stakeholders interested in opening a **coffee shop** in **Toronto City**.\n\nSince there are already a lot of coffee shops in Toronto City, we will try to find areas that **still have a few of coffee shops**, and would also prefer that the locations **close to universities**. We will look what kind of coffe shops are available near the area, and gain insight to decide **what kind of coffee shops that we need to build**, to differentiate us with the other existing coffee shops or and to understand the customer's preference on coffee. \n\nWe will use data science algorithm to explore and analyze the data to find the best neighbourhoods, and use the insights that we gain **to decide where are the most optimals options and generate the final location chosen by the stakeholder**."
